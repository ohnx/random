crystalbot
==================
A simple IRC bot written in perl that responds to all messages containing the words "crystal ball" and ending in "?" with a yes/no/maybe answer.

If asked something ending with "ok?" it will reply with "ok."

If the message contains "help" and "crystal ball", it will reply with a help message.

It also greets people joining a channel with a message.

Yay perl.
