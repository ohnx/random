# colorize
A bash script to make text awesomer.

Usage:

`colorize-line.sh`:
Pass it input from `stdin` (or a pipe) and it will output to `stdout` (or a pipe) that same line, but with a random color.
`colorize-char.sh`:
Pass it input from `stdin` (or a pipe) and it will output to `stdout` (or a pipe) that same line, but with each character having a random color.

The world needs more rainbows.
